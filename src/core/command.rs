//! Command identifiers - constants for all UI commands and messages.
//!
//! Standard command values match Borland Turbo Vision (views.h / dialogs.h /
//! stddlg.h). Always refer to commands by these constants, never by numeric
//! value — port-specific commands occupy gaps in Borland's numbering and may
//! be renumbered.
