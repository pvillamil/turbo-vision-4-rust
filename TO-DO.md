# TO-DO — Code Review Action Items

From the 2026-07-02 review of `turbo-vision-4-rust` v1.3.1 vs the kloczek/tvision C++ reference. Work top to bottom.

## P0 — Critical (broken or unsafe)

### UTF-8 byte/char index mixing (panics on non-ASCII input)
- [x] `input_line.rs` — cursor/selection/paste now char-indexed, byte offsets computed at the string-op boundary
- [x] `editor.rs` — search rewritten in char space (also fixes wrap + whole-word `continue` bug)
- [x] `memo.rs` — `get_selection` uses char-based skip/take
- [x] `paramtext.rs`, `terminal_widget.rs` — truncate by chars
- [x] (bonus) clipboard: OS pasteboard access serialized + skipped under `cfg(test)` — fixes pre-existing flaky SIGSEGV in parallel tests
- [x] (bonus) global HistoryManager tests serialized via test lock — fixes test-order flake

### Unfinished features that look done
- [x] Radio buttons now mutually exclusive via `CM_RADIO_SELECTED` broadcast with group id in new `Event.info` field
- [x] Clusters (checkbox/radio) now respond to mouse clicks
- [x] ColorDialog reads selections back via shared `Rc<RefCell<u8>>` values on the selectors
- [x] History wired end-to-end: button click → `CM_SHOW_HISTORY` → popup opened by Dialog/Application; `CM_RECORD_HISTORY` broadcast on dialog OK records linked InputLine data; selection copied back via `CM_HISTORY_SELECTED`; HistoryWindow viewer coordinates fixed
- [x] SortedListBox incremental type-to-search implemented (typing extends prefix, Backspace shrinks, navigation resets); prefix compare also made UTF-8-safe
- [x] Menu item hot keys dispatched while the bar is closed via recursive `Menu::find_hotkey` (Borland findHotKey), gated on the global command set

### Editor correctness
- [x] Enter / line-join deletes now recorded as `InsertText`/`DeleteText` with `\n`; `DeleteText` replay handles embedded newlines; overwrite mode is a single Compound undo step; regression tests added
- [x] `replace_all` infinite-loops when replacement contains pattern — fixed by removing search wrap-around (Borland-faithful); regression test added

### SSH / network
- [x] SSH auth is now default-deny: `SshAuthPolicy` with `auth_password_fn`/`auth_publickey_fn` callbacks and explicit `allow_anonymous()` opt-in (example updated)
- [x] `poll_event` honors its timeout (sleep-poll, near-idle CPU); backend errors now stop the app via `poll_event_or_quit` instead of spinning on dead sessions
- [x] SSH resize broadcasts `CM_REDRAW`; `handle_redraw` queries `terminal.backend_size()` instead of crossterm
- [x] Input parser: pending-sequence buffer capped at 64 bytes with resync; partial X10 mouse waits for all 6 bytes; regression tests added

## P1 — High (visible divergence from C++)

- [x] Enter presses the focused button; `am_default` grab/release on focus change; CM_GRAB/RELEASE_DEFAULT fixed to Borland 61/62
- [x] Disabled commands no longer fire from status line (key + mouse) or MenuBox (Enter + mouse); disabled-selected menu items draw dimmed
- [x] Positional events hitting no child are dropped; Frame close button tracks press+release on the icon
- [x] Per-child grow modes (GF_GROW_*) with Borland calcBounds semantics; default fixed
- [x] `SF_ACTIVE` propagates via Window::set_focus to window + frame; inactive palette now used
- [x] Auto-close honors `valid(cmClose)` — children can veto
- [x] Modal views tracked by ViewId; `valid(endState)` re-entry in Group/Dialog execute; InputLine validators can veto OK
- [x] Command IDs renumbered to Borland values (breaking change; constants-only contract); KB_CTRL_F12 fixed to BIOS 0x8A00
- [x] PictureValidator is a full TPXPictureValidator port (incl. groups/repetition/alternatives); auto-fill wired into InputLine typing via Validator::complete()
- [x] File dialog follows Borland's wildcard→dir→file order (typed paths return the file); real glob matching (`*`/`?`)
- [x] Dropdown hit-testing uses the real rendered width (shared dropdown_width helper)
- [x] Palette repairs: zeroed app bytes restored, CP_BLUE_DIALOG points at a restored Borland blue region, CP_CLUSTER matches Borland

## P2 — Medium (feature gaps / semantic drift)

- [x] Editor: Ctrl+arrows word movement, Ctrl+Backspace/Del word delete (single undo step), Ins overwrite toggle (persistent blocks and literal tabs remain deliberate deviations)
- [x] Memo passes Tab through for dialog focus (Borland TMemo)
- [x] FileEditor: opt-in `.bak` backups; saves preserve CRLF and trailing-newline style
- [x] Indicator shows Borland `line:col` (1-based)
- [x] `put_event` slot, Alt+1-9 window selection with frame-drawn numbers, CM_ZOOM dispatch + double-click-title zoom, CM_RESIZE keyboard move/resize, StatusDef switching driven from idle (zoom ICON drawing still not rendered — visual polish only)
- [ ] Status line sees events last instead of first; app hard-codes Alt+X/F1/F12 — deliberate for now (reordering risks shadowing regressions); revisit if user-defined status hotkeys are needed
- [x] Focus chain skips SF_DISABLED children and never drops focus when no other candidate exists (SF_VISIBLE unused in this port)
- [x] Broadcasts delivered to all children; focus re-established after removing the focused child
- [x] Tile uses Borland mostEqualDivisors/dividerLoc exact fill; cascade extends all windows to the corner (tileError min-size check still omitted)
- [x] Scroller clamps to limit-minus-page (Borland setLimit); flat scrollbar when nothing to scroll; CM_SCROLLBAR_CHANGED constant added (mouse auto-repeat still absent)
- [x] enable/disable_range accept single-command ranges and clamp; init_command_set disables Borland's five window commands
- [x] Quit during modal returns CM_QUIT
- [x] Frame titles centered with Borland clamping
- [x] InputLine: select-all-on-focus, Shift+arrow selection, Ins overwrite mode (`max_length` counts characters — documented deviation from Borland's NUL-inclusive count)
- [x] `set_esc_timeout` works via Backend::as_any_mut downcast
- [x] Global history mutex tolerates poisoning (clipboard already guarded)

## Deliberate deviations — document in README instead of fixing

Vec<String> buffer, multi-step undo/redo, CUA keybindings, markdown help format, "commands < 1000 close dialog", double-ESC cancel (inconsistent with single-ESC menus), 65k disableable commands, per-list history caps, adaptive msgbox layout, degenerate `Rect::contains`, draw buffer always overwriting attributes.
